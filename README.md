# Y2-Mobile-App
Module to develop an Android mobile app of our choosing.

We were given the freedom to create any mobile app that we want, so i created a badminton related coaching app due to my involvement with the Loughborough Badminton Club.
The app was to be developed using Android Studio and Java.

I recieved a 1st for this project.
